# Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard is a website that explores the data from [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).   It allows a testing ID to be chosen from the drop down that is pre filled with Testing IDs.   Once a testing ID is chosen, the top 10 Bacteria for that testing ID is charted  via a bar and a pie chart. Additionally a bubble chart of all of the sample values with the bubble size indicating the sample value and a washing frequency gauge for the chosen testing ID is included in the dashboard.
